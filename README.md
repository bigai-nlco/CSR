# Varying Sentence Representations via Condition-Specified Routers

## Updates

- (2024.09.20) Our Paper have been accepted by **EMNLP 2024**üî•üî•.

## üöÄ Overview

In this paper, we propose a **C**onditioned **S**entence **R**epresentation (**CSR**) method based on the tri-encoder architecture, with the goal of enhancing its performance without introducing external parameters while maintaining computational efficiency. Condition semantics ought to play the role of influencing which tokens in the sentence should contribute to the final condition-specific sentence embedding. Our approach obtains different score distributions for a sentence based on different conditions, thereby generating varied conditioned sentence representations.

We evaluate our method on the C-STS task and Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task, demonstrating significant improvement over previous frameworks while maintaining memory and computational efficiency.
